# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# User.create([ 
#     {username: "truth_seeker88", first_name: "Ben", last_name: "Kissel", password: "test"},
#     {username: "i-believe", first_name: "Henry", last_name: "Z", password: "test"},
#     {username: "#1skeptic", first_name: "Marcus", last_name: "Parks", password: "test"},
